# SQL-Covid-Data-Exploration
In this project, I explored the COVID dataset from ourworldindata.org using SQL to uncover valuable insights. I applied advanced SQL techniques, including Joins, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Temporary Tables, Window Functions, Aggregate Functions, and Data Type Conversions. Additionally, I created views to streamline data analysis and enhance query performance.
